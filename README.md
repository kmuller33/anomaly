# Anomaly detection of 40 years of Canadian Climate History

This notebook uses 80 years of Canadian climate history data and uses both univariate and multivariate anomaly detection to calculate the anomaly score of precipitation and temperature in Vancouver, BC. 

The algorithms used are: 

- Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS)
- Cluster-based Local Otulier Factor (CBLOF)
- Isolation Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
